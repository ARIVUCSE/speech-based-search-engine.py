Here's a basic `README.md` file for your **Speech-Based Search Engine** project:

# Speech-Based Search Engine

This is a simple Python-based voice-activated search tool. It allows users to perform Google searches by speaking their queries aloud. The program captures the spoken input, converts it to text using speech recognition, and then opens a browser window with the search results.

## Features

* Voice input using your system microphone
* Google search based on recognized speech
* Text-to-speech feedback

## Requirements

Before running the program, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> **Note:** On some systems, installing `pyaudio` may require additional setup. For example, on Windows, use:
>
> ```bash
> pip install pipwin
> pipwin install pyaudio
> ```

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user with audio asking for a search query.
2. It listens through the microphone and captures the audio input.
3. The input is processed using Google's speech recognition API.
4. The recognized query is opened in a new browser tab using Google Search.
5. The assistant confirms the search using text-to-speech output.

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python "speech based search engine.py"
```

Then speak your search query clearly into your microphone when prompted.

## Limitations

* Requires an internet connection for Google's speech recognition.
* Accuracy depends on microphone quality and background noise.
* Limited to English language recognition by default.
